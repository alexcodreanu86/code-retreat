## Code Retreat project.

* [Conway's Game of Life Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmoeDNgfEKAYD7Kz-ITcS1eEyS923-wZjVStaShetQU/edit)
* [Four elements of simple design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9hidMBt4F5Mmwq80-XKmgtDGV11cqz6pp-i819jJJE/edit)


### Day Itinerary
* Pair program the entire day on the same problem Conway’s Game of Life
* We’ll write code for 45 minutes, then we’ll delete any code we have written
* 5-10 minutes retro after each session
* 5 minutes to find the next pair for the next session and receive instructions for the next session
* 2 session before lunch
* 3-4 session after lunch
* Each session will have a certain set of constraints that will be explained before we start the session


### Rounds
Try mixing object oriented one round, functional in a different round.
1. Free Form
2. Clean Code. Focus on naming, no Conditinals. switches and pattern matching is a form of conditional (kinda).
    Only four lines per method (Bonus line for java, total of 5).
3. [Silent Ping Pong Pairing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16_8WcKliYtPu_71uukiZDPLB65MxcZCkycjIVQ1Ejtw/edit) All intent is expressed through tests.
4. [Baby Steps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6MTVWa88xEyDkv4jUq5tNbypSvPnthbA3shmB28rbc/edit)
5. [Evil Pair](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcAUdyrfTtmU2KYZacmaTNZgk_sB6eZIv13DSyUUSOU/edit)

Other Ideas
* [No Primitives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RSvUaGhxf8Gc46wEVAGgyGRDAE8YSZrQwIC70UukxsE/edit)
* No return value.
* TDD as if you meant it
* [Verb-Noun Naming](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1231bDylwm3IQ3mpLV4-sF_QYUoJeNM3ZnBROOgx11VE/edit)
* [Yes, and](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Uulhj_X2huOpE3_RJioGKIV_trYxTCLDuuPiAUhsqM/edit)
* Software Design, start coding knowing that some requirements will change. See what assumption you made about your project.
* No Mouse. Only if both pairs are using an IDE they are familiar with.
